# Me: What's the difference between blank and null in django

# AI: 
# In Django, `blank` is a property of a field that defines whether the field 
# can be left blank when creating or updating a record. If `blank=True`, 
# the field can be left empty in forms. If `blank=False`, the field is 
# required and cannot be empty. `null` is a property of a field that defines 
# whether the field can be set to `NULL` in the database. If `null=True`, the 
# field can be left empty in the database and will store a `NULL` value. If `null=False`, 
# the field cannot be left empty
# and the database will store an empty string or a default value.

# Me: Use some code to demonstrate

# AI:
# Here's a code example to demonstrate the difference between `blank` and `null` 
# in Django models:

from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    char_field = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    char_field_required = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=False, null=True)
    char_field_not_null = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=False)
    char_field_not_null_required = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=False, null=False)

# In this example, char_field is a character field that can be left empty in both 
# the form and the database. char_field_required is a character field that is required in 
# the form, but can be left empty in the database. char_field_not_null is a character field 
# that can be left empty in the form, but cannot be left empty in the database.
# char_field_not_null_required is a character field that is required in both the form and the
#  database.
